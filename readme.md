### Yes, I'm doing this again.

[Here's V1](https://github.com/Phoenix-Net/Retriever) if you haven't seen it already. Basically, I built the original Retreiver project with some friends after realizing I can't write a lick of JS. The ORIGINAL predecessor of Retreiver was a bot I made in highschool called ["Tennisball"](https://github.com/PhoenixSheppy/Tennisball), it was the foundation of what made Retreiver great, say funny command, get funny dog picture in return.

Retreiver-ng aims to do the exact same thing, but brought upto modern Discord standards, as command interpretation has changed and code is never 100% polished.

I'm going to drop a roadmap below just to have a skeleton of some-sort as to what I have planned. I have yet to decide if I want to rope my friends into helping me with Retreiver-ng yet, but if you end up on the contributors list, you're special in my heart.

* - [ ] Create a bot "account" to host Retreiver-ng
* - [X] Setup environment variables, let's not have a repeat of last time (the bot got stolen and abused literally 5 minutes after I accidentally uploaded the token...)
* - [X] Build a command handler, if/then-chaining is how a project goes to SCRUM hell.
* - [ ] Redo the "OG" commands to the best of my ability.
* - [ ] Determine the best way to host assets (embedded pictures, attached pictures, GIFs, etc.) that the bot may use when interacting with other users.
* - [ ] Add new features.
* - [ ] Test, test, and then test it again.
* - [ ] Go public on various bot-list websites.
* - [ ] Become the next @Nexure and make a bunch of money.

That's about it for now, as I'm rebuilding this from the ground up, I'll finally be opensourcing [Retreiver](https://github.com/Phoenix-Net/Retriever) as I don't plan on hosting it again. It's pretty much worthless seeing as how Discord.JS has been reworked from the ground up.
